Review: This is my first review on the IMDb website and i have been a member for more that 9 years now, that is who much i loved this movie. It just give you that positive thoughts and energy within a lovely comedian scenario. I loved how they mix between the classic culture with the modern one. It was very interesting to watch how they remind our generation about the habits which they are missing from the classic one. De Niro and Anne Hathaway have excellent work chemistry. Director and camera teams made a great job too... Team work, thank you for this lovely movie...

Review: Two things struck me about this film as awful. First, for such a huge budget film, did they really have to play the same music over and over and over and over and over again? Was not there funding to find someone with a sense of artistry to select better music or at least a wider variety of sounds? Second, the writing was awful and the dialog was idiotic. Was not the least bit interested in either of the two lead characters. I would have left before it ended, but we paid full price and I am an optimist: I kept expecting it to get better. It did not. On the plus side, the sets and wardrobe were nice.

Review: I watched the whole thing! My bad. I was hoping it would get better at some point but it just dragged on and on and on endlessly. Robert DeNiro deserves the worst actor category of 2015 and Hathaway is not far behind. However watching DeNiro is just embarrassing. Having gone from one of the best actors in film to possibly the worst is just hard for a movie fan to take. Ca not he just retire with some dignity? Does he have to made a fool of himself with all the trash he appears in lately? Does he need money that badly? We should all have a charity fund for him rather than watch him become a grade "B" (no make that a grade "F") actor. It is hard to watch!

Review: I watched it twice to make sure I had not actually stumbled into the twilight zone of bad movies, and guess what ? it is worse the second time. the story, characters, scripts all had me feeling like I swallowed a bottle of ipecac. the silly and corny background music really drives the point home that this thing is bad. watching the star of the deer hunter doing a lame imitation of mr.rogers is painful, and looking at bobby standing in that silly stance with the hands folded and making that mr rogers smile is just more than I can bear. maybe age of bobby is to blame ? the movie is not even worth the 10 lines that requires for a posted comment.
